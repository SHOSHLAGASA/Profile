      Savvy Coder Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp – 2021 Agile
    </p>
    <p>Certification through ICAgile – 2021</p>
    <p>
      Savvy graduates receive a Scrum certification from ICAgile. They have
      demonstrated their understanding of the Agile/Scrum Methodology by
      presenting a final Capstone Project that embodies the methodology and
      project preparation. The students work in Jira, create User Stories,
      manage tasks and contributions to Sprints in Jira. They work in teams to
      plan Sprints, hold daily standups to groom the backlog, and participate in
      weekly Sprint Retrospectives. They work on selected user stories and keep
      communication flowing to ensure everyone is on the same page for the next
      increment of work. All project tracking is done in Jira

      collections, so l built a website for children’s clothing.
